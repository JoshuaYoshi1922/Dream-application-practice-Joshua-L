1 - The applications I would build are for those who like to collect sports cards. Whether it is baseball, basketball or football, anyone who uses it will be able to log their sports card into this application. This would also be useful not just for sports fans, but would be great for Trading card games like Pokemon.  All the user would have to do is take a picture of the card front and back and the application will log it into the phone by player name, sport, position etc.  If the user wants to search for a specific player or Pokemon, all they have to do is search for their name or team they play for. This will make it very easy to categorize and log all your cards for faster reference to see what cards you do or don't have.

2. 
Organization and Time Management -  Creating a to-do list to stay organized will help immensely to help keep track of tasks that should be completed on a day to day basis. Staying organized will help with keeping on a tight schedule for deadlines.

Values, Data Types, and Operations - In the lesson about naming variables, having proper and clean variables will be important as to not get mixed with other variable names. It will keep readability high and organized for simple writing.

The Growth Mindset - Having a growth mindset will be crucial when building an application. Seeking out for feedback when I am stuck or confused will be a big building block and learning the ins and out of coding.

Stringing Characters Together -  Knowing how to use and understand strings is one of the core tasks in writing code. When building an application I could use the .charAt and .toUpperCase together to capitalize the first letter of the baseball player's name or type of pokemon in the search bar for more accurate searching.

Control Structures and Logic- When writing code, I understand that I will most likely make mistakes. But it is also up to me to try and figure out what mistakes I made and how to correct it, especially with logic errors, syntax errors and runtime errors.

Working with Loops - With the use of the doâ€¦while loop, this method helps with password protection.

Building Arrays - Having a multiple object type array will be the core of the application. This is where all the cards will be organized by name, sport, position etc.

Using Arrays - Using .filter() will come in handy when sorting and organizing for searching a specific card within the array.
